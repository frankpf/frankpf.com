Hey, I'm frankpf. I'm an undergraduate CS student at UFSC and this is where I write about programming and computer science.

If you'd like to talk to me, send me an email at <a href="mailto:me@frankpf.com">me@frankpf.com</a>! I try to respond to all of my email. My PGP public key is <a href="https://keybase.io/frankpf/key.asc">15FA 1F01 7BFE 9961</a>.

My main interests right now are low-level code optimization and distributed systems. You can find my code at <a href="https://github.com/frankpf">GitHub</a>.
